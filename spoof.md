The sensor output to the car computer is cut and a spoof line from the car controller is attached to the computer end of 
the cut. The controller has a digital to analog converter (MCP4922T) to send correct amount of voltage. 

An example from OSCC data file:
For maximum torque to left we need to pull to 4.26 volts for the high sensor line.
